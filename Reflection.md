## Effect of PID terms

### P term

P term gives output which is proportional to the error term. The value of this term is equalt to constant multiplied by error. 

P term = Kp*error

High value of Kp tries to reduce the error faster. But too high value will make the system unstable. Very low value of Kp makes the system response slow
